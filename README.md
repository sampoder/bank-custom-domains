What if my Hack Club Bank donatation page had a custom domain?

This world would be a cooler place!

So here's how you make it possible:

1. Click the big blue deploy to Vercel button
2. Choose a project name and click continue
3. Choose a name for what you'd like your project's git repo to be
4. You'll now have to fill out the required enviromental variable: `username`. This is your bank username, you can find it by inspecting the URLs. For example `bank.hackclub.com/hq`'s username would be `hq`.
5. If you'd like extra customisation you can add the following optional enviromental variables:
    - meta_image: this is an image URL that'll be your social media preview image
    - description: this is a string that'll be your social media preview description
    - title: this is a string that'll be the title of your website
    - site_name: this is a string that'll be the name of the website, shown in some social media previews
    - custom_css: a link to a css file that'll be added, hack around with the bank site to get classes ;)
6. Click Deploy!!
7. Follow [Vercel's docs](https://vercel.com/docs/custom-domains) to set a custom domain.
8. Profit!!

Hope this helps some folks - Sam
